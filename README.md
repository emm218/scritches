# Scritches üê±

I have some problems with existing solutions for scrobbling my music to last.fm
with MPD so I'm trying to roll my own

## Configuration

The config file is stored in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/scritches` by default and can use
any of the file formats supported by the
[config](https://crates.io/crates/config) crate (YAML, TOML, etc.) as long as
the part before the extension is `config`.

Current config values:
- `mpd_addr` the TCP address to connect to MPD at (default `localhost:6600`)
- `mpd_socket` the path to a unix socket to connect to MPD at (default none)
- `mpd_password` the password to connect to MPD with (default none)

any of these config values can also be set using command line options, which
will override the value read from the config file.

## Notes

Limitations on how MPD reports events make it non-trivial to tell when a song is
repeated. The logic used here works fine in the normal case of listening to a
song all the way through before restarting but breaks slightly in the case of
restarting a song over and over. I don't know why you'd do that though.

## Features Todo

- use MPD client to client messages to enable loving tracks
